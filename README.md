## Gold-Bar Classic WoW Energy Ticker For Rogues

Currently works for Rogues; Druid support TBD, need to level a Druid to 20 to test.  

Changes color right before energy ticks. *Can look into allowing user to change bar colors and bar orientation (vertical or horizontal)*  

Displays current energy. *I messed around with displaying predicted energy upon tick completion, but it can be confusing since energy gains are not always +20*  

Can be dragged into position on screen.  

**Download file, move Gold-Bar folder into your AddOns folder.**
