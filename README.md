# Gold-Bar Classic WoW Energy Ticker For Rogues

Currently works for Rogues; Druid support TBD, need to level a Druid to 20 to test.  
Changes colors right before energy is ticks.  
Displays current energy. *I messed around with displaying predicted energy upon next tick, but it can be confusing since energy ticks are not always +20*
Can be dragged around the screen.  

Download files, move the Gold-Bar folder into your AddOns folder.
